<I><B>My IT Background:</I></B>

<p>I have taken an interest in IT and would like to learn more about it as I have found in my time since starting a full time job how influential and important IT is in day to day activities as 99% of my tasks involve a computer or some other type of technology whether that be spreadsheets, software programs and internet. 
I have done a basic intro course into excel spreadsheets during my study and found this interesting and usual. </p>

<i><b>What do I expect to learn:</b></i>

<p>I expect to gain more skills and knowledge around IT and ways that may make my work easier and more effective. </p>

<I><B>Why RMIT?</B></I>

<p>When looking at going back to study I was encouraged to use open university/RMIT so I chose to give them a go.</p>

<I><B>Ideal Job:</B></I>

<p>I am already on the path to my ideal job as I am already in the industry.
My ideal job is to be a financial adviser and I have found an advertisement on Seek looking for a strategic financial adviser in Melbourne CBD.</p> 

<i><p><b>Description and qualifications required for the role:</b></i>
As a strategic financial adviser, your role is to provide advice in the areas of investments, super and pension to a different range of clients varying from a young family just starting out to a retiree. You will be providing each client with a strategy that meets their goals and objectives. 
You will be responsible for managing their portfolio, ensuring their portfolio is properly administrated, implement strategic advice and conduct annual reviews with each of your clients. 

This role is particularly interesting to me because you are helping people reach their goals and each client will have a different situation that your advice needs to be tailored to. 

The skills and qualifications of the role include minimumRG146, an approved degree and a CFP is desired with a minimum of 3 years planning experience. 

I am currently RG146 compliant and have completed my diploma and advance diploma of financial planning. I also studying a bachelor of business financial planning. 
I am on my way to completing the studying requirements and I plan on becoming an adviser assistant and then an associate in order to gain more knowledge and insight into the role of an adviser.

<I><B>Personal Profile Test Results:</I></B>

<I>I completed the 16 personalities test which gave the following results:</I>
<ul>
  <li>Extraverted 57%</li>

<li>Observant 66% </li>

<li>Feeling 71%</li>

<li>Judging 78%</li>

<li>Turbulent 57%</li>
</ul>

I agree with them all except for being <b>57%</b> extraverted as I am generally an introverted person. 

<i>I also completed the education planner quiz and they gave me the following results:</i>
<ul>
  <li>Auditory 20%</li>

<li>Visual 40%</li>

<li>Tactile 40%</li>
</ul>
 <p>Based on the Myers Briggs test I am vision and meaning oriented. Which I agree with.

Although the results for the first test says I’m extraverted, this is not the case. I am generally introverted when it comes to group situations so I need to ensure that I speak up and raise my ideas and concerns. 
By having more a feeling and judging approach, I will be able to assess the situation and think of my responses before jumping to conclusions or starting arguments if I don’t agree with an opinion. </p>
